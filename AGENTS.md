## Documentation

Refer to the `docs/` folder for detailed guides:

- `docs/nix/` — Adding packages (nix, brew, casks, node, Mac App Store)
- `docs/vscode-and-cursor/` — Custom shortcuts and settings

## Keyboard shortcuts

When modifying keyboard shortcuts, always edit `os/mac/karabiner-goku/karabiner.edn`.

After any change, run `goku` to validate the configuration compiles correctly.

## Git

- If you think it makes sense to split something into separate commits, go ahead and do it.
- Do not autocommit
