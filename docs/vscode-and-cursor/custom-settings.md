# Custom Settings in VSCode and Cursor

Each editor has its own settings file:

- **VSCode:** `editors/vscode/settings.json`
- **Cursor:** `editors/cursor/settings.json`

Both share most configuration but can diverge for editor-specific features. If a setting should apply to both, update both files.

Run `rebuild` after changes.
