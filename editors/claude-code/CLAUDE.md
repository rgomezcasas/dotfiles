- **Language:** Use only English for code, including comments, documentation, examples, commits, configurations, errors, and tests.
- **Style**: Prefer self-documenting code over comments.
- **Comments**: DON'T use comments to explain code.
- **Inclusive Terms:** Use allowlist/blocklist instead of whitelist/blacklist, primary/replica instead of master/slave, and so on.
- **Tools**: Use `rg` instead of `grep`, `fd` instead of `find`, and if needed, use `tree` to understand directory structure.
- **Implementations**: On non-test code, using mocks are FORBIDDEN. Create the real implementation like PostgresUserRepository.
